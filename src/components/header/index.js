        I did'nt practice for about 4 month, because of my difficult life-situation.
        To make it fast  I use CRA boilerplate to make it in time.
        Unfortunately I didnt open al my knowledge's and skills in this task:
        I didnt use Redux, Saga or other middleware - I dont see a reason to use in such ease task.
        So here it is:
    </p>
    </div>
);
export default Header;
